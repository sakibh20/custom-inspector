# 🛠️ Unity Custom Inspector for Hierarchical ScriptableObjects

This project showcases a **custom Unity Inspector** built to simplify editing complex **ScriptableObject hierarchies**. When dealing with deep inheritance trees and diverse data types, Unity’s default inspector becomes cluttered — showing fields that aren’t always relevant.

This tool addresses that by displaying **only the necessary fields** for the actual subclass type, streamlining the editing experience.
